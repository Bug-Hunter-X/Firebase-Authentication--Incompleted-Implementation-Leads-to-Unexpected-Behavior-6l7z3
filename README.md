# Firebase Authentication Incompleted Implementation
This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase authentication:  incomplete implementation after successfully signing in or out. The provided code only sets up the authentication state listener but lacks the core functionality that should execute based on the user's authentication status. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.

## Bug Description
The JavaScript code initializes Firebase and listens for authentication state changes using `onAuthStateChanged`. However, it doesn't include the actual actions that should happen when a user is signed in (e.g., redirecting to a protected page, displaying user data) or signed out (e.g., redirecting to the login page, clearing user data). This omission causes unexpected behavior because the application doesn't react appropriately to the authentication status.

## Solution
The solution involves adding the missing functionality within the `onAuthStateChanged` callback. For example, if a user is signed in, you might redirect them to a protected page or display their profile information. If a user is signed out, you might redirect them to the login page.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Replace placeholders in `firebaseConfig` with your Firebase project configuration.
3.  Run the `firebaseBug.js` file.  Note the lack of meaningful response to authentication state changes.
4.  Observe the improved behavior after reviewing and implementing the solution in `firebaseSolution.js`.
